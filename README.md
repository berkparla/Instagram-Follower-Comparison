# Instagram-Follower-Comparison

This project provides a JavaScript tool to compare your Instagram followers and followings, identifying users who don't follow you back and users you don't follow back.

# Disclaimer

This tool is for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and be aware that excessive use may violate Instagram's terms of service or trigger rate limiting.

# Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge)
- Your Instagram user ID

# How to Use

1. Log in to Instagram in your web browser.
2. Open your browser's developer tools.
3. Navigate to the "Console" tab in the developer tools.
4. Copy the entire content of instagram_follower_comparison.js and paste it into the console.
5. Press enter to run the script.
6. When prompted, enter your Instagram user ID.

The script will fetch your followers and followings, then display:

- Users who don't follow you back
- Users you don't follow back

# Finding your Instagram User ID 

You can find your Instagram user ID using third-party tools or by inspecting network requests in your browser's developer tools while using Instagram.

# Limitations 

- This script relies on Instagram's current web structure and API endpoints. It may stop working if Instagram makes significant changes.
- Instagram may have measures to detect and prevent automated access. Use this tool sparingly to avoid potential account restrictions.
